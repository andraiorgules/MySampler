## Final Project : MySampler
A Sampler VST that I made using the JUCE framework. This is the first VST I have ever created, as well as my first time using JUCE and C++.

## Description 
This Sampler plugin is very easy to use. First, locate the sound files you would like to use and "drag and drop" them onto the box. You can use ".wav", ".aif", or ".mp3" files. Once the sound file is loaded, the text will disappear and be replaced with a purple background. The waveform for your sound file will be drawn on top of the purple background, and the name of your sound file will be displayed in the upper right corner. If you would like to use a different sound file, simply "drag and drop" it on top of the old one. The waveform and sound file name will also update to reflect the new sound file. The ADSR Envelope is very easy to use: simply drag the knobs upwards to increase the value and downwards to decrease the value. You can also double-click on the boxes underneath the knobs to manually put in the value you would like to use. As you play your sound file, a playhead will follow along and give you a visual representation of what part of the file is currently playing. The playhead will also slightly darken the areas that have already been played.
